## Flask CRUD Operations Project Description

### Overview
🚀 This Flask project implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing student records. It provides a user-friendly interface for performing these operations, allowing users to add, view, edit, and delete student information.

### Features
1. **Add Student**: 📝 Users can add new student records by providing their name, age, and grade.
2. **View Students**: 👀 The application displays a list of all existing student records, allowing users to view their details.
3. **Edit Student**: ✏️ Users can modify the information of existing students, including their name, age, and grade.
4. **Delete Student**: 🗑️ The application allows users to delete student records from the database.

### Project Structure
📁 The project follows a typical Flask application structure:

- **app.py**: The main application file containing the Flask routes and logic.
- **templates/**: Directory containing HTML templates for rendering pages.
- **static/**: Directory for storing static files such as CSS and JavaScript.
- **models.py**: Module defining the database models using SQLAlchemy.
- **database.db**: SQLite database file to store student records.

### Installation and Setup
To run the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the project repository from GitHub.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Flask application: `python app.py`.
4. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Technologies Used
- **Flask**: 🌐 Python web framework used for building the application.
- **SQLite**: 📦 Lightweight relational database management system used for storing student records.
- **SQLAlchemy**: 🗃️ Object-relational mapping (ORM) library used for interacting with the database.
